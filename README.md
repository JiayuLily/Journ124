I picked the question "Under normal circumstances, does a person who reclines their seat during a flight have any obligation to the person behind them?" because it shows a common but debating issue in travel etiquette. I found this dataset interesting because it links personal opinions on flight courtesy to larger context of travel policy preferences on whether reclining seats should be banned. The chart below visualizes how respondents who believe passengers should be obligated or not when reclining, which can help policy makers to decide whether to eliminate reclining seats. It reveals that among 854 respondents, a significant majority of 543 people believe in some form of obligation to the person behind them, reavealing that personal values around space sharing and social responsibility are two strong factors that influence opinions on policy level changes, even in daily occasions like air travel seating.
